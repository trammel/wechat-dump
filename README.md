## Dump WeChat Messages from Android

WeChat(微信), as the most popular mobile IM app in China, failed to allow users to export well-formatted chat history.
This tool can parse and dump WeChat chat history on a rooted android phone.

### How to use:

#### Dependencies:
+ python-PIL
+ [PyQuery](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyquery/1.2.1)
+ [pysox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysox/0.3.6.alpha)
+ [dill](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill)
+ numpy
+ python-csscompressor(optional)
+ adb and rooted android phone connected to PC
+ gnu-sed

#### Get Necessary Data:


+ Get decrypted WeChat database (Linux & Mac Only):
	+ Automatic: `./android-interact.sh db_decrypt`
                + Requires rooted adb. Available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.adbd&hl=en
	+ Manual:
		+ Get /data/data/com.tencent.mm/MicroMsg/long-long-name/EnMicroMsg.db from *root* filesystem, possible ways are:
			+ `./android-interact.sh db`
			+ Use your rooted file system manager app
		+ Get WeChat uin, possible ways are:
			+ `./android-interact.sh uin`
			+ Login to [web wechat](https://wx.qq.com), get wxuin=1234567 from `document.cookie`
		+ Get your phone IMEI number, possible ways are:
			+ `./android-interact.sh imei`
			+ Call `*#06#` on your phone
			+ Find IMEI in system settings
		+ Decrypt database, will produce `decrypted.db`:
		```
		./decrypt_db.sh <path to EnMicroMsg.db> <imei> <uin>
		```
+ Get WeChat user resource directory from your phone to `resource` directory:
	+ `./android-interact.sh res`		# you might need to change the resource location in this script if the default doesn't work

#### Run:
+ Parse and dump text messages of every contact (resource directory is not required to run this):
```
./dump_msg.py decrypted.db output_dir
```
+ Dump messages of one contact to rich-content html, containing voice messages, emojis, and images:
```
./dump_html.py decrypted.db resource <contact name> output.html
```
+ Generate statistical report on text messages:
```
./report.sh message_dir
```

### TODO
+ (IMPORTANT) Audio file encryption method for latest version of wechat.
+ Export all messages to libchat, and render messages from libchat
+ Search by uid/username
+ Skip existing files when copying android resources
+ Fix rare unhandled types: > 10000 and < 0
+ Better user experiences... see `grep 'TODO' lib -R`
+ more easy-to-use for non-programmers (GUI?)
